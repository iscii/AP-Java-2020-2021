Unit 4: Iteration
>i. Contains no infinite loops.
>ii. Includes a return statement inside a loop. //object array
>iii. Uses a for loop and/or while loop - include in the comments why for/while is better decision.
>iv. Contains no “off-by-one” errors. [array out of bounds]
>v. Uses nested iteration (i.e. loops within loops).
>vi. Uses statement execution counts.

Unit 5: Writing Classes
>i. Uses only public classes.
>ii. Uses only private attributes to encapsulate data.
>iii. Uses only public constructors.
>iv. Uses at least one public and at least one private method.
>v. Includes all necessary accessor and mutator methods.
>vi. Includes a constructor with an object as one of its parameters.
>vii. Includes a class with instance variables but no constructor.
>viii. Includes Javadoc comments (i.e. /** */).
>ix. Includes at least one precondition and one postcondition.
>x. Includes non-void methods.
>xi. Includes at least one method that returns an object other than a String.
>xii. Includes a toString method and prints an object.
>xiii. Includes a void method other than the main method.
>xiv. Includes a static method other than the main method.
>xv. Includes a method that alters a static variable in a different class. -> public static setter
>xvi. Uses the this keyword.
>xvii. Is reliable.
>xviii. Creates no legal issues nor intellectual property concerns.

Unit 6: Arrays
>i. Uses an array of primitive data.
>ii. Uses an array of object references.
>iii. Uses an initializer list to create an array.
>iv. Uses iteration to traverse an array.
>v. Uses an enhanced for loop.
>vi. Determines the minimum and maximum values in an array.
>vii. Computes the sum, average, and mode of an array.
>viii. Determines if at least one element of an array has a particular property. //object array
>ix. Determines if all elements of an array have a particular property. //object array
>x. Accesses all consecutive pairs of elements in an array.
>xi. Determines the presence or absence of duplicate elements.
>xii. Determines the number of elements meeting specific criteria. //object array
>xiii. Shifts elements of an array left or right.
>xiv. Reverses the order of the elements of an array.
